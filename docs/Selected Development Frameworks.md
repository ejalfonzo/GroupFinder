We have decided to use the following frameworks:

For our front-end we will be using javascript with Bootstrap, Eduardo and Angel are both comfortable with javascript and jQuery, but Bootstrap will provide faster prototyping.

For out back-end or server we will be using php, this is because all the members of the team know how to use it and Angel is very comfortable with this language, though should the need arise to use another framework, the entire team is comfortable with Java as a backup.

Our choice of DBMS technology will be mySQL, it's very popular and well documented, as well as it easily connects to our host service on dreamhost, we all had the workbench installed, which means we have all used it to some extent in the past.
