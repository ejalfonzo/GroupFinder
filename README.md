For Phase 3 we completed all basic objectives from the Master Project Development Plan:

- Business basic functionality
- Search Results functionality

Work was begun on:
- Post functionality
- Friends functionality
- Post functionality
- RESTful architecture changes
- Email functionality

What worked well?
Programming tasks assigned unilaterally by priority.

What didn't work well?
Communication, tasks are still not being completed until the last moment. While queries are ready or done quickly, the front-end isn't and is being left until the last moment because most of the group is too aware of the 'real' deadline and sandbags.

What we learned?
We need to come together, learn the requirements and deliver farther away from the deadline.


For the next phase:
- Post functionality
- Friends functionality
- Post functionality
- RESTful architecture changes
