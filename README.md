What worked well?

Splitting labor, using a repository and PM tools like Trello worked really well. It made creating documentation and high-level requirements really easy.

What didn't work well?

Not finding a thrid teammate until the last couple of days means we had a lot more work per person.

What we learned?

We need a tool like GroupFinder to establish well-rounded work groups with ample time before starting projects. Markdown is a pretty good way to document projects. And we really don't need jQuery in our project.
