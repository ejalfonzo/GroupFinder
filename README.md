Project Phase 2

Current completed deliverables:
- Register User
- Log-in
- User Dashboard
- Groups in user dashboard

For Phase 2 we completed all 2/5 basic objectives from the Master Project Development Plan and begun work on the other 3:
- User Page
- Groups Basic Functionality

Work was begun on:
- Post functionality
- Friends functionality
- Events functionality

What worked well?
Programming tasks assigned by volunteers, the work went faster, but it was a very disfunctional phase.

What didn't work well?
Communication, tasks were not being completed on time or at all. Everyone is working at random currently instead of following the master development plan and asking for help.

What we learned?
We need to coordinate and set clearer goals, now.


For the next phase:
- Post functionality should be available to the user in his own timeline.
- Search should be working.
- Adding friends to a user's list.
