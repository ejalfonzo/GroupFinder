# GroupFinder v0.5

Project Phase 1

Current completed deliverables:
- DBMS instance
- App Mockups are on site in the /mockups directory
- MPDP has been updated.
- Project management tool has been updated
- Project plan for Phase 2 is complete

For Phase 1 we completed all 5 basic objectives from the Master Project Development Plan:
- Base Site is up and running at ebabilon.com
- Working DBMS instance is active and being used (see 'OnServerERD.pdf' document in /docs for a reverse engineered view)
- Mockups are on the site at /mockups
- Home Page Search Prototype is in the landing/index page of the site
- User basic functionality is implemented, letting a user register and login

What worked well?
Division of labor, plain and simple, one person doing all the work is too much.

What didn't work well?
Communication, tasks were completed but the work is a bit disjointed and we don't know when a person is finishing work. More micro management is needed.

What we learned?
Programmers who aren't used to asynchronous work are confused easily by php and web design in general.


For the next phase:
- The user panel should be completed.
- The mockups should be in place around the site in their proper location and style.
- Users should be able to write a Post.
- Users should be able to find each other and add to friends.
- Work on Groups should be started. (View and Create)
