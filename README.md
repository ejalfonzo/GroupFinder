For Phase 5 we completed all basic objectives from the Master Project Development Plan.

What worked well?
Programming tasks assigned unilaterally by time allowance and priority.

What didn't work well?
Timing and communication. Some of us had exams and projects due so timing and communication were a big issue this phase.

What we learned?
With proper management and a well defined project, even bad communication and timing can't stop a team.


For the next phase:
- There is no next phase.
